    Welcome to the game! Please be patient while waiting for enough players to connect
    <span id="span_dots">.</span><br/>
    Currently connected: <span id="span_connected"></span><br/>
    <br/>
    If at least <span id="span_atleast"></span> clients are connected a countdown to start the game will be launched.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Due to the game design, we can accept only an exact number of players: 9, 12, 15, or 16 players. If at the end of the countdown the number of connected clients differs from what requested, the clients allowed to play will be selected randomly.
