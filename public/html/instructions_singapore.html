      <div id="random">
        <p>Welcome to our
        experiment! <span id="players-count">X</span> people, that is
        you and <span id="players-count-minus-1">X-1</span> others,
        have joined us.</p>

        <p><strong>Your decision.</strong><br /> You will
        receive <strong>20</strong> coins per round
        for <span id="rounds-count">X</span> rounds. Each round, you
        will have to choose how many coins to put directly into your
        personal account, and how many coins to put into a group
        account.</p>

        <p><strong>Return from personal account.</strong><br /> Each
        coin that you put into your personal account each round goes
        one-to-one towards your final earnings in the game.</p>

        <p><strong>Return from group account.</strong><br /> Each coin
        that you and the other participants put into the group account
        will be summed up, and you will receive half of the total.</p>

        <table class="table table-striped">
          <thead>
            <tr>
              <th>Total number of coins in group account</th><th>Your return</th>
            </tr>
          </thead>
          <tbody>
            <tr><td>0</td><td>0</td></tr>
            <tr><td>10</td><td>5</td></tr>
            <tr><td>15</td><td>7.5</td></tr>
            <tr><td>28</td><td>14</td></tr>
            <tr><td>...</td><td>...</td></tr>
          </tbody>
          <tfoot>
            <tr><th>Any amount</th><th>Half of that amount</th></tr>
          </tfoot>
        </table>

        <p><strong>Total return.</strong><br />You will be paid
        according to the final amount of coins earned over the whole
        experiment. 20 coins are equal to 0.075 USD, and the maximum
        amount you can win is 800 coins, equivalent to 3 USD.</p>
